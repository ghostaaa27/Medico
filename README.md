#ASP.net core web API:
A web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser [9]. It is a web development concept, usually limited to a web application's client-side (including any web frameworks being used), and thus usually does not include web server or browser implementation details such as APIs or APIs unless publicly accessible by a remote web application.

#Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries [5]. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Flask server code:
